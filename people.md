**Dr. Yan Zhang, Research Assistant Professor**
<br/>Research Interests: Dr. Zhang obtained her Ph.D. in 2012 in Civil & Environmental Engineering from the University of Tennessee. She holds another Ph.D. in Microbiology from the Chinese Academy of Science, a M.S. in Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmacy, and a B.E. in Microbiological Pharmaceutics from Shenyang Parmaceutical University, China. Dr. Zhang's Ph.D. research focused on the microbiome in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. After completing her Ph.D., Dr. Zhang began her postdoctoral training in 2013 at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. Her current research focuses on the microbiome of ticks and Lyme disease, as well as the interaction between the microbiome and host in health and disease. Her work utilizes next generation sequencing to address three fundamental questions in microbiome sciences: 1) the role of the microbiome in health and disease; 2) how the tick microbiome influences pathogen infection and transmission; and 3) the interaction between the causitive agent of Lyme disease *Borreliella burgdoferi* and the host immune system to uncover the mechanisms of *B. burgdorferi* immune evasion and persistence.
