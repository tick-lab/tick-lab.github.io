<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tick-lab/tick-lab.github.io/master/img/Michael_Allen.jpg"> 
**Dr. Michael S. Allen, Associate Professor and Lab Director** 
<br/>Research Interests: Host-microbiome interactions, vector-borne microbial diseases, microbial forensics, probiotics.
Dr. Allen received his Ph.D. from the University of Tennessee in 2002. After serving as a postdoc and later Research Leader at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, he accepted an Assistant Professor position at The University of North Texas. In 2012, he moved to UNTHSC in Fort Worth, TX and became Director of the Tick-Borne Disease Research Laboratory. His research focuses on the microbiomes of human, animal, and environmental systems, and the roles these play in host health and pathogen transmission.

**Dr. Yan Zhang, Research Assistant Professor**
<br/>Research Interests: Dr. Zhang obtained her Ph.D. in 2012 in Civil & Environmental Engineering from the University of Tennessee. She holds another Ph.D. in Microbiology from the Chinese Academy of Science, a M.S. in Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmacy, and a B.E. in Microbiological Pharmaceutics from Shenyang Parmaceutical University, China. Dr. Zhang's Ph.D. research focused on the microbiome in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. After completing her Ph.D., Dr. Zhang began her postdoctoral training in 2013 at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. Her current research focuses on the microbiome of ticks and Lyme disease, as well as the interaction between the microbiome and host in health and disease. Her work utilizes next generation sequencing to address three fundamental questions in microbiome sciences: 1) the role of the microbiome in health and disease; 2) how the tick microbiome influences pathogen infection and transmission; and 3) the interaction between the causitive agent of Lyme disease *Borrelia burgdoferi* and the host immune system to uncover the mechanisms of *B. burgdorferi* immune evasion and persistence.
